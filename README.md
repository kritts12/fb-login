# fb-login

This project is a Facebook Login Automation script using Selenium in Python. The script automates the process of logging into a Facebook account by taking the user's email/username and password as input, then using a Chrome WebDriver to open Facebook's login page. It locates the input fields for the email and password, enters the provided credentials, and clicks the login button. The goal is to automate the login process, making it useful for testing or other automation tasks.

Key technologies involved:

Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
Python for scripting the automation.
